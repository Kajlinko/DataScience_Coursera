# R Markdown

## R Markdown Syntax

To make bullet points, use - (hyphen) and end the line with two spaces.
The remaining points will be listed using bullets
- for bold **surround text with two asterisks** like this **  
- for italics *use a single asterisk* like this *  
- for links type the text to be shown in square brackets, followed by the URL in brackets [Link:](https://www.google.com)  
- to run inline R code use a single back tick `"like this"`
- headings uses #, the number of hashtags indicates the heading level
- finally surround a chunk of code with three backticks ``` (see below) or insert it by going to code > insert code chunk.

## Trying R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

Or this: 

```{r print}
print("Hello World!")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
